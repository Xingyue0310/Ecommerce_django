# Ecommerce_django
This is a single project. 

The web application is a buy and sell marketplace website where users could list their products for selling, or they could also make a purchase by making a payment.

This project were deployed to an actual server but now it's no longer active.

The project is based on Django and the MVP architecture and is connected with build-in Object Relational Mapper Django database.

I used Tailwind and CSS to style up the frontend pages.

The application is be able to perform basic CRUD functionality, authentication, user's profile, redirect, pagination



search functionality which allows the end user to search for any product depending upon its name.


integrate a payment gateway with Stripe into our web application so that we could accept payments




deploy our websites to public Internet
