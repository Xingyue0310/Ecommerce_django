# Ecommerce_django
The web application is a buy and sell marketplace website where users could list their products for selling, or they could also make a purchase by making a payment.

This project were deployed to an actual server but now it's no longer active.

The project is based on Django and the MVP architecture, and is connected with build-in Object Relational Mapper Django database.

Used Tailwind and CSS to style up the frontend pages.

The application is be able to perform basic CRUD functionality, authentication and redirect function.

I also designed user's profile and products pagination.

I also implemented search functionality which allows the end user to search for any product depending upon its name.

I integrated a payment gateway with Stripe into our web application so that we could accept payments.
